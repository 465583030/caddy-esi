If you are filing a bug report, please take a few
minutes to carefully answer the following questions.

### 1. What version of Caddy and the ESI middleware are you using (`caddy -version`)?


### 2. What are you trying to do?


### 3. What is your entire Caddyfile?
```text
(paste Caddyfile here)
```

### 4. How did you run Caddy (give the full command and describe the execution environment)?


### 5. Please paste any relevant HTTP request(s) here.

(paste curl command, or full HTTP request including headers and body, here)


### 6. Please enable debug mode in the ESI middleware, re-run the requests and attach the log file this issue. Note that the log file may contain sensitive information which you must strip out.


### 7. What did you expect to see?


### 8. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?


(Please strip away any extra infrastructure such as containers, reverse proxies,
upstream apps, caches, dependencies, etc, to prove this is a bug in Caddy and
not an external misconfiguration. Your chances of getting this bug fixed go way
up the easier it is to replicate. Thank you!)
